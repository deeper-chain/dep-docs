# Part 1: Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on the Decentralized Edge-Computing Platform (DEP), a cutting-edge innovation brought to you by Deeper Network. This platform has been created to enable seamless execution of Web2/Web3 tasks and applications through the decentralized efforts of Deeper Connect nodes. 

In essence, DEP represents a new Web3 infrastructure, capitalizing on the decentralized abilities of each Deeper node. As an independent service provider, each node operates on blockchain technology to execute tasks while earning rewards. 

The fundamental principle behind DEP revolves around continuous monitoring of specific events through decentralized tasks published on the blockchain. This novel approach stimulates different execution workflows based on diverse events, providing a decentralized launch environment for Web3 applications. In essence, DEP has revolutionized how we perceive traditional blockchains by creating a closed-loop blockchain ecosystem, introducing information back from the Web3 into Web2.

Throughout this tutorial, we'll cover the DEP ecosystem in depth, beginning with its core principles and going into its various structural elements, applications, and future plans. We'll also delve into practical examples and hands-on exercises to ensure you can apply your knowledge in real-world contexts.

Let's dive in and discover the world of DEP, unlocking the potential of decentralized edge computing for Web3 applications!
