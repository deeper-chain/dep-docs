## 8. Next Steps

Congratulations on completing this DEP application development tutorial! Here are some additional resources and steps you can take to continue learning and developing on DEP.

**Advanced Tutorials:** After mastering the basics, try more complex projects to further develop your skills. Look out for advanced tutorials on the [DEP documentation page](https://docs.deeper.network/).

**Dive Into the Documentation:** DEP's [documentation](https://docs.deeper.network/) is an excellent resource for learning more about the platform's features, capabilities, and development protocols. It's a good place to look for answers to specific questions or to get a deeper understanding of DEP.

**Join Hackathons:** DEP and other organizations often sponsor hackathons, which are a great way to apply your skills and collaborate with other developers. Keep an eye out for these opportunities.

**Contribute to Open Source:** DEP's [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/deeper-chain) are open-source and contributions are welcomed. Whether it's bug fixes, feature enhancements, or new feature proposals, your contributions will be valuable.

**Build Your Own Project:** Nothing accelerates learning like practical application. Consider developing your own DEP application. This will give you the opportunity to apply what you've learned and gain hands-on experience.

Remember, learning is a journey. The DEP community is here to support you as you explore and develop on this exciting platform. Happy coding!
