# 6. Troubleshooting 

Here are some common issues you might encounter while using DEP and their respective solutions:

## Issue 1: Ethereum address not generating after downloading the public beta firmware

**Solution**: Check your internet connection. If the problem persists, try reinstalling the firmware.

## Issue 2: Unable to start winning tasks

**Solution**: Make sure you have at least 2 DPR in your Deeper wallet. If the problem persists, try turning on the DEP page switch.

## Issue 3: Not winning enough tasks

**Solution**: The number of tasks won is related to your node's network environment, network speed, and current loading. Improving these factors can increase the number of tasks won. Turning on the proxy server can also help.

## Issue 4: Not receiving daily proof work rewards

**Solution**: There is no maximum daily reward limit. Rewards depend on the number of tasks completed per day. Ensure you are completing tasks, and wait for a day for the rewards to show.

## Issue 5: Unable to withdraw DPR rewards

**Solution**: Make sure you click "Withdraw" to distribute the rewards to your Deeper wallet. If the problem persists, check your Deeper wallet balance on Deeperscan.io.
